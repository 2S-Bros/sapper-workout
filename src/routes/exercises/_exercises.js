// Ordinarily, you'd generate this data from markdown files in your

// avoid unnecessary dependencies in the starter template, and in the
// service of obviousness, we're just going to leave it here.

// This file is called `_exercises.js` rather than `exercises.js`, because
// we don't want to create an `/blog/posts` route â€” the leading
// underscore tells Sapper not to do that.
